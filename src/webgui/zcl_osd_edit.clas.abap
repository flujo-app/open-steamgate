CLASS zcl_osd_edit DEFINITION PUBLIC CREATE PUBLIC.
* The editor, on the screen (backlog G.8): pick an object, change its source,
* check it, activate it. In a browser, out of our own tree, with no Eclipse
* and no JavaScript.
*
* **It writes through the store, not beside it.** The backlog called "where
* does an edit land?" the first item of G.8's estimate. It had been answered
* on 2026-09-15 by the ADT facade and nobody wrote the answer back:
* `ObjectStore.write()` lands an object in the file it came from, in its own
* layer, as the two files abapGit would write, and marks it inactive until a
* check clears it. So this screen calls that -- `CALL FUNCTION 'ZOSD_STORE'
* DESTINATION 'STORE'` (tools/osd-store-destination.mjs) -- and an edit made
* here and an edit made from Eclipse are the same edit, in the same file,
* with the same activation behind them. A screen that wrote sources its own
* way would agree with Eclipse until the first day it did not.
*
* **Why a destination and not a door of its own**: the store is a Node object
* holding the tree, the abaplint registry and the build, and none of that
* exists inside the transpiled runtime. The AMDP tile reaches HANA this way
* and the ST05 screen reaches the trace ring this way. This is the third user
* of that seam rather than a third seam.
*
* **Check and Activate are two buttons on purpose.** Measured 2026-09-19 on a
* tree of 1518 objects: a check is a parse, about four seconds; an activation
* is the check over the object *and everyone who uses it*, and then a build,
* which is twelve seconds and never cached -- the build cache is keyed by
* content and an edit is new content by definition. One name over a cheap and
* an expensive operation is a button people stop pressing, so the screen has
* both and says what each costs.
*
* **No JavaScript**, like the rest of the webgui: a form, a textarea, and
* links. The screen's zero-script property is asserted by a test, and an
* editor is "state between requests plus a click", which is exactly what the
* webgui session already is.
