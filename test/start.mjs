// and what the browser preview is built from. Its limit is why the other
// shape exists: Node pins a module graph for the life of a process, so code
// activated through the façade, or saved on disk, is never live here.
//
// Child is the workbench: this process is the façade, the static files and
// a proxy, and loads no ABAP at all. The system runs in tools/osd-serve.mjs,
// a process the supervisor replaces after a successful build — OData, every
// ICF service, the push channels, and the door the data preview reads
// through. One generation, one database, and every consumer on them.
// STG_SERVE=child asks for it; test/run.mjs, the way a server is started,
// defaults to it; a suite that calls startServer() itself stays inline.
